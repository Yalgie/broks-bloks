# Broks Bloks

This game started as a simple Tetris remake but as development went on it started to become this entirely new game with awesome features, music and art. My friend [h3xmode](http://www.h3xmode.xyz/) did all the incredible pixel art and I built out the game with Phaser JS.

Unfortunately it was one of those things were as time went on we just eventually stopped working on it. I hope to finish it one day, but for now you can play it here: [https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/broks-bloks](https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/broks-bloks)
